# Node_JS_basic

This project contains basic scripts to demonstrate Node.js functionalities such as reading files, handling HTTP servers, and working with asynchronous operations.

## Files

- `0-console.js`: Prints a message to the console.
- `1-stdin.js`: Reads input from the standard input.
- `2-read_file.js`: Reads a CSV file synchronously and prints student information.
- `3-read_file_async.js`: Reads a CSV file asynchronously and prints student information.
- `4-http.js`: Creates a basic HTTP server that responds with "Hello Holberton School!".
- `5-http.js`: Creates a more complex HTTP server that also reads student information from a CSV file.
